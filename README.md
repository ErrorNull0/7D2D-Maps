MAPS

This is the main game world. Choose the folder that matches the MAP you want and copy it into the folder where all your other game maps are located. For single player, this is usually your "GeneratedWorlds" folder. On a dedicated server, the folder is typcially located in the DATA > WORLDS folder. For dedicated servers, be sure the serverconfig.xml file has the "Gameworld" parameter set to the map/folder name you chose above.

PREFABS

These are the structures that are part of a map. Choose the folder that matches the PREFAB you want and copy it into the "LocalPrefabs" folder. The LocalPrefabs folder should be inside the same folder where the GeneratedWorlds and Saves folders are.
